Teams were assembled under the patronage of Aristocrats and purses were put up for ‘great matches’.\\n\\nIn 1696, ‘ a great match at Cricket was played in Sussex, they were eleven of a side, and they played for fifty guineas apiece’.\\n\\nThe game had been growing both within the english upper classes and as a genuine recreational past time for rural workers in the southern counties of England.\\n\\nThe composite teams that were beginning to be assembled for ‘great matches’ during this period of the early 1700’s, were crossing the class divides; as the purses played for encouraged the nobility that were patronizing the teams, to employ the best players that could be found.\\n\\nThus, rural workers who had become adept at the game were being employed to play as ‘hands’ for the aristocracy and were travelling for their employ.\\n\\nAt this time London, particularly North London, can lay claim to being the cradle of the game as matches staged in Islington at White Conduit Field had a ‘field keeper’ for cricket and the Angel Inn as part of its amenities.\\n\\nIn 1718 a match at White Conduit Field brought cricket into the law courts after a dispute between the two teams.\\n\\nThe other area to lay claim to the ‘Cradle of Cricket’ was Hambledon in Hampshire, where the matches staged at the Broad Down of Halfpenny were where cricket began to ‘ assume that truly skilful and scientific character which it now possesses.’\\n\\nThe men of Hambledon were immortalised in the writing of John Nyren, who captured the spirit of the club, its segregation between the classes and its rich and varied club life.\\n\\nThe game continued to spread through England as the provincial towns grew with industrialization, with the first recorded game in Yorkshire played in the 1750’s.\\n\\nThe Laws of the Game\\n\\nBy 1744 the Laws of Cricket had been codified and in 1788 the laws were revised by the Marylebone Cricket Club, they covered the length of the pitch, the distance between creases, wicket size, and ball weight.\\n\\nAfter 1760 the game saw the evolution of over arm bowling, replacing under arm bowling as the main way to deliver the ball. The game began to see the use of various lengths utilised by bowlers and the development of the craft of batting, as batters sought to respond to new bowling techniques.\\n\\nThe ‘Straight Bat’ was introduced as part of this counter to new bowling techniques, the old bent ‘hockey stick’ style of bat went out of fashion.\\n\\nSee the pictures here from a display at the Lords Museum that show the bats evolution\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Global Spread of Cricket\\nCricket began to spread with Britains’ Imperialist ambitions, the Navy and Army were instrumental in its spread into the Colonies, with games being recorded in North America in the 1700’s.\\n\\nIn the 1800’s cricket had reached the West Indies and India, by 1788 at the inception of colonization in Australia the game was played and in the 19th century cricket had reached and was being played in South Africaand New Zealand.\\n\\nThe first International match was staged in New York in 1844 between Canada and the United States. In 1868 an Australian Aboriginal side toured England and by 1877 England played their first match against Australia to begin the games oldest rivalry.\\n\\nIn 1882 England lost to Australia, a mock obituary was written for English cricket and two Melbourne ladies burnt a bail and presented it to the England cricket captain in an urn.\\n\\nThus began the Ashes,the games longest running saga as the two sides play off every two years for the fabled urn.\\n\\nIn 1889 South Africa became the third test nation.\\n\\nIn 1900 cricket made its one and only appearance at the Olympics, England played France and won. Although interestingly, it looks as if cricket may be re-admitted to the Olympics in its shortest form, 20 20 cricket.\\n\\nBy 1909 the Imperial Cricket Conference was formed to administrate the game, primarily from an English perspective, with England, South Africa and Australia being its founder members.\\n\\nIndia, the West Indies and New Zealand saw them become Test playing nations before the second WW, Pakistan joining after.\\n\\nAffiliate nations like Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, Zimababwe and Bangladesh have become Test playing nations toward the end of the twentieth century.\\n\\nCrises in Cricket\\nThe Twentieth Century saw major crises in cricket, initially in the bodyline series in 1932 -33 between Australia and England.\\n\\nEnglands’ method of countering the genius of Don Bradman lead them to bowl to a leg side field with short pitched bowling. The Australians deemed this ‘not cricket’ and against the spirit of the game. It was an event of such proportions that Australia threatened to take political action they were so disturbed by it.\\n\\nThen in the 1970’s the D’Oliveira Affair blew South Africa from the international cricket stage for over twenty years, as they refused to receive the England team with the Cape Coloured Basil D’Oliveira in it.\\n\\nIts racist policies saw it cast into the wilderness only to return after the release of Nelson Mandela and the institution of multi racial cricket.\\n\\nThe 1960’s and 70’s saw the introduction of single innings games, with the first class sides in England playing limited over cricket, these proved hugely popular and cricket saw its first One Day International in 1971 between England and Australia.\\n\\nIn the mid 1970’s an Australian Media Mogul, Kerry Packer, bought up the worlds best cricketers and set up World Series Cricket, the players played in coloured clothing. Packer took on the cricket establishment in a legal battle for the right to host and televise games and won.\\n\\nWorld Series Cricket went a long way to professionalising the game in the 1970’s and allowing the players a living wage from their profession.\\n\\nTechnology: Innovation or Invasion\\nAs the One Day game developed it brought with it some of the innovations from Tennis and American football, the use of technology to bring better decision making for umpires and to highlight areas of interest for the TV audience.\\n\\nBeginning with slow motion replays and specialist camera angles for Umpires, the game now has space age technology with ‘Stump Cams’,’Hot Spots’ and ‘Hawk Eye’, technology derived from modern warfare.\\n\\nWhether technology has improved the decison making of Umpires remains to be seen, there have been breakdowns in the application of technology and its lack of uniform roll out across all international games undermines its credibility.\\n\\nT20 Cricket: Rebirth or the Death of Cricket As We Know it?\\n \\n\\nTwenty Twenty Cricket was born in England in the early 2000’s, it literally exploded into new market places in cricket, it brought with it a new audience and target market.\\n\\nIt was spectacularly seized upon by the BCCI after the 2007 Twenty Twenty World Cup as they set up the Indian Premier League with the worlds best players, modelled on the English Premier League Football Competition.\\n\\nIt is now the worlds second biggest sporting event, second only to the Olympics, because of India’s vast population and sub-continent marketplace.\\n\\nHow it grows will remain to be seen, whether it consumes itself with overkill or goes on to be the biggest growth area in cricket in the 21st century, only time will tell.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# ***Training
