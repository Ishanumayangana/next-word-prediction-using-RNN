Next Word Prediction using RNN and LSTM

This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. The model is built using TensorFlow and trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle.
Overview

Next Word Prediction is a natural language processing (NLP) task where the goal is to predict the next word in a sequence of words. This task is typically addressed using deep learning techniques such as RNNs and LSTMs due to their ability to capture sequential patterns in data.
Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is obtained from Kaggle. It comprises a large collection of text data which is preprocessed and used to train the model. Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset cannot be included in this repository. However, you can download it directly from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
